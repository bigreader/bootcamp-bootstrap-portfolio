					<p>I'm interested in designing and creating in the space between information and people â€“ coding websites, drawing icons, laying out pamphlets, and everything in between.</p>
					<p>I've been playing with computers and programming since I was 9, and I've always been excited to learn new technologies. In 2010, I started working in graphic and UI design and quickly realized it was exactly what I loved to do. Since then, I've worked with multiple clients on graphic design projects, created and launched two apps on the iOS App Store, and continue to hone my skills in design through classes, personal projects and client work.</p>
